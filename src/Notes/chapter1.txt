 What is Compiler ?
  -  Java not interpreted language where at runtime the virtual machine
     had to translate straight from a text editor source code.
  - It cant allow variables to hold data of the wrong type.
  - There  could be some datatypes exceptions that can emerge at run time.
  - Checking semicolons

Notes:
In Java everthing goes in a class.You will type your source code file (with a .java extension ), then compile it into a new class file (with a .class extension).
When you run your program, you are running a class.

Running a program means telling the JVM to "Load the MyFirstApp class" then start executing its main method. Keep running till all the code in main is finished.
